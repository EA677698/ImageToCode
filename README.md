# ImageToCode
A program to convert Images into pixels which are supposed to be iterated through and painted to recreate the image. (This was meant for a project but I scrapped this idea. It is fully functional however.)


Just enter the URL into the terminal and the image will also be converted in front of your eyes. The resulting conversion will be exported as a custom file extension being javaL in the output folder. To load it into your program, copy and paste the pixel and image classes from this program into yours and load it in using serialization. The file will load in a Image[].
